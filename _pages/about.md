I'm recent graduate of MIT, with a BSE in Nuclear Science and Engineering. At MIT, I did research on computational reactor physics and nuclear material development. During my undergrad and continuing into my PhD, my focus has consistently been on applications of nuclear technology to space exploration. I worked as an intern with NASA MSFC my junior year on reactor models of the Centrifigual Nuclear Thermal Rocket, and began working with Analytical Mechanics Associates on solid core NTP that summer. With AMA, I've developed transient modeling capability for solid-core NTP, methodology for prediciting fission product release, and DAGMC-based dose mapping. Starting as a PhD student at the University of Michigan's Plasma Science and Technology lab, I'll be researching power conversion for nuclear electric propulsion. I'm interested in not only the technical aspects of space nuclear power, but also the political: there are many unanswered questions in that domain that I intend on looking into further during my PhD.
